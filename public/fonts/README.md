Place your Janna LT font files here.

Expected filenames (used by CSS in client/global.css):

- JannaLT-Regular.woff2  — the regular weight (400)
- JannaLT-Bold.woff2     — the bold weight (700)

How to obtain and add fonts:
1. Acquire the font files legally (purchase or license where required).
2. Copy the .woff2 files into this folder.
3. Restart the dev server if it's running to pick up the new assets.

If you don't have these files, the site will fall back to Inter / Cairo / system fonts.
